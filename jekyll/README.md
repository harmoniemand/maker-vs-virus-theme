# Purpose

This website is intended to bring together people and organisations
who need hard-to-find protective equipment or spare parts with makers and makerspaces who can
possibly produce them. Behind this is a small German and English speaking organization team.

The goal is for people to come together in a self-organized way to form (local or international) production
hubs, which we can list on this website. For this purpose we offer the following Slack workspace to find
fellow Makers or existing hubs in need of help. If you want to register as a new producing hub,
please write in the Slack channel called "Register Hub". <strong>Please note: </strong> We only list
initiatives that offer their (self) produced items for free or at cost price.

# How to Add a Producing Hub to the Website

Open `_data\hubs.yml` and add an entry ([how to edit files](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository)). Then open a pull request ([how to create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)).
